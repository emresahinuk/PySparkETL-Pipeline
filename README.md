Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework, that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, a framework which is used for processing, querying and analyzing Big data. 

Computation is done in memory hence itâ€™s multiple-fold fasters than the competitors like MapReduce and others with the rate at which terabytes of data is being produced every day.
